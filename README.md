# Vimb - the Vim-like browser

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/fanglingsu/vimb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fanglingsu/vimb)

Vimb is a Vim-like web browser that is inspired by Pentadactyl and Vimprobable.
The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and
pleasurable browsing-experience with low memory and CPU usage that is
intuitive to use for Vim users.

## Install

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup.

Edit `src/config.h` to match your personal preferences.

The default `Makefile` will not overwrite your customised `config.h` with the
contents of `config.def.h`, even if it was updated in the latest git pull.
Therefore, you should always compare your customised `config.h` with
`config.def.h` and make sure you include any changes to the latter in your
`config.h`.

Run the following commands to compile and install Vimb (if necessary, the last one as
root). If you want to change the `PREFIX`, note that it's required to give it on both stages, build and install.

    make PREFIX=/usr
    make PREFIX=/usr install

To run vimb without installation for testing it out use the 'runsandbox' make
target.

    make runsandbox
