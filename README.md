Vimb is a Vim-like web browser that is inspired by Pentadactyl and Vimprobable.
The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and
pleasurable browsing-experience with low memory and CPU usage that is
intuitive to use for Vim users.

More information and some screenshots of Vimb browser in action can be found on
the project page of [Vimb][].

## Install

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup. You might need to do this if 
you use another compiler, like tcc. Most people, however, will almost never 
need to do this on systems like Ubuntu or Debian.

Edit `src/config.h` to match your personal preferences, like changing the
characters used in the loading bar, or the font.

The default `Makefile` will not overwrite your customised `config.h` with the
contents of `config.def.h`, even if it was updated in the latest git pull.
Therefore, you should always compare your customised `config.h` with
`config.def.h` and make sure you include any changes to the latter in your
`config.h`.

Run the following commands to compile and install Vimb (if necessary, the last one as
root). If you want to change the `PREFIX`, note that it's required to give it on both stages, build and install.

    make PREFIX=/usr
    make PREFIX=/usr install

To run vimb without installation for testing it out use the 'runsandbox' make
target.

    make runsandbox
