## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Added completion of bookmarked URIs for `:bmr` to allow to easily remove
  bookmarks without loading the page first.
* Refresh hints after scrolling the page or resizing the window which makes
  extended hint mode more comfortable.

### Changed

* Number of webprocesses in no longer limited to one.
* Treat hint label generation depending on the first hint-key char.
  If first char is '0' generate numeric style labels else the labels start with
  the first char.
  * `hint-keys=0123` -> `1 2 3 10 11 12 13`
  * `hint-keys=asdf` -> `a s d f aa as ad af`
* Show versions of used libs on `vimb --bug-info` and the extension directory
  for easier issue investigation.
* During hinting JavaScript is enabled and reset to it's previous setting after
  hinting is done might be security relevant.
* Allow extended hints mode also for open `g;o` to allow the user to toggle
  checkboxes and radiobuttons of forms.
* Rename `hint-number-same-length` into `hint-keys-same-length` for consistency.

### Fixed

* Deduced min required webkit version 2.16.x -> 2.8.x to compile vimb also on
  older systems.
* Fixed undeleted desktop file on `make uninstall`.
* Fixed window not redrawn properly in case vimb was run within tabbed.
* Fixed cursor appearing in empty inputbox on searching in case a normal mode
  command was used that switches vimb into command mode like 'T' or ':'.
* Fixed hint labels never started by the first char of the 'hint-keys'.
* Fixed items where added to history even when `history-max-items` is set to 0.
* Fixed hinting caused dbus timeout on attempt to open URI with location hash.
* Fixed wrong scroll position shown in the right of the statusbar on some pages.

## [3.0-alpha] - 2017-05-27

### Changed

* completely rebuild of vimb on webkit2 api.
* Syntax for the font related gui settings has be changed.
  Fonts have to be given as `[ font-style | font-variant | font-weight | font-stretch ]? font-size font-family`
  Example `set input-font-normal=bold 10pt "DejaVu Sans Mono"` instead of
  previous `set input-fg-normal=DejaVu Sans Mono Bold 10`
* Renames some settings to consequently use dashed setting names. Following
  settings where changed.
  ```
