.SH NAME
Vimb - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on WebKit, inspired by Vim: the
great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vimb
.OP OPTIONS
.RI [ URI "|" file "|" - ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vimb is a WebKit based web browser that behaves like the Vimperator
plugin for Firefox and has usage paradigms from the great editor, Vim.
The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient
and pleasurable browsing-experience.
.SH OPTIONS
If no \fIURI\fP or \fIfile\fP is given, Vimb will open the configured
home-page.
If \fIURI\fP is '-', Vimb reads the HTML to display from stdin.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-config " "FILE"
Use custom configuration given as \fIFILE\fP.
This will also be applied on new spawned instances.
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-embed " "WINID"
.I WINID
of an XEmbed-aware application, that Vimb will use as its parent.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show help options.
.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-profile " "PROFILE-NAME"
Create or open specified configuration profile.
Configuration data for the profile is stored in a directory named
\fIPROFILE-NAME\fP under default directory for configuration data.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
Print build and version information and then quit.
.TP
.B "\-\-bug-info"
Prints information about used libraries for bug reports and then quit.
.SH MODES
Vimb is modal and has the following main modes:
.TP
.B Normal Mode
The default mode.
Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.
.TP
.B Input Mode
Used for editing text elements in a webpage.
.TP
.B Command Mode
Execute `ex` commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).
.TP
.B Pass-Through Mode
In Pass-Through mode only the `<Esc>` and `<C-[>` keybindings are interpreted
by Vimb, all other keystrokes are given to the webview to handle them.
This allows the use of a website's configured keybindings, that might otherwise
be swallowed by Vimb.
.SH NORMAL MODE COMMANDS
Some of the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply the
effect of the command.
If a command supports the count this is shown as \fB[N]\fP.

.SS Hinting
Hinting in Vimb is how you accomplish the tasks that you would do with the
mouse in common mouse-driven browsers: open a URI, yank a URI, save a page and
so on. When hinting is started, the relevant elements on the page will
be marked by labels generated from configured `hint-keys'.
Hints can be selected by using <Tab>, <C-I> or <C-Tab>, <C-O>,
by typing the chars of the label, or filtering the elements by some text
that is part of the hinted element (like URI, link text, button label)
or any combination of these methods.
If <enter> is pressed, the current active hint will be fired.
If only one possible hint remains, this will be fired automatically.
.PP
.BI Syntax: " ;{mode}{hint}"
.PP
Start Hints mode.
Different elements depending on \fImode\fP are highlighted and `numbered'.
Elements can be selected either by typing their label, or by typing part
of their text (\fIhint\fP) to narrow down the result.
When an element has been selected, it is automatically clicked
or used (depending on \fImode\fP) and hint mode ends.
.PP
The filtering of hints by text splits the query at ' ' and use the single parts
as separate queries to filter the hints.
This is useful for hints that have a lot of filterable chars in common
and many chars are required to make a distinct selection.
For example ';over tw' will easily select the second hint out of
{'very long link text one', 'very long link text two'}.
.PP
The following keys have special meanings in Hints modes:
.PD 0
.IP \fB<CR>\fP
Selects the first highlighted element, or the current focused.
.IP "\fB<Tab>\fP"
Moves the focus to the next hint element.
.IP "\fB<S-Tab>\fP"
Moves the focus to the previous hint element.
.IP "\fB<Esc>, CTRL\-C, CTRL\-[\fP"
Exits Hints mode without selecting an element.
.PD
.TP
.B Hint modes:

.TP
.B ;I
Open hinted image in a new window.
.TP
.B ;p

`:qunshift' command.
This is only available if Vimb was compiled with the QUEUE feature.
.TP
.B ;x
Hints like ;o, but instead of opening the hinted URI, the
`x-hint-command' is run in Vimb.
.TP
.BI [ \(dqx ];y
Yank hint's destination location into primary and secondary clipboard and into
the register \fIx\fP.
.TP
.BI [ \(dqx ];Y
Yank hint's text description or form text into primary and secondary clipboard
and into the register \fIx\fP.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI Syntax: " g;{mode}{hint}"
Start an extended hints mode and stay there until <Esc> is pressed.
Like normal hinting, except that after a hint is selected, hints
remain visible so that another one can be selected with the same action
as the first.
Note that the extended hint mode can only be combined with the following
hint modes \fII o p P s t y Y\fP.

.SH COMMAND MODE
Commands that are listed below are ex-commands like in Vim, that are typed
into the inputbox (the command line of vimb).
The commands may vary in their syntax or in the parts they allow,
but in general they follow a simple syntax.
.PP
.BI Syntax: " :[:| ][N]cmd[name][!][ lhs][ rhs]"
.sp
Where \fIlhs\fP (left hand side) must not contain any unescaped space.
The syntax of the rhs (right hand side) if this is available depends on the
command.
At the moment the count parts [N] of commands is parsed, but currently there is
no command that uses the count.
.sp
Commands that are typed interactivly are normally recorded into command
history and register.
To avoid this, the commands can be prefixed by one or more additional `:' or
whitespace.
.PP
Multiple commands, separated by a `|' can be given in a single command line
and will be executed consecutively.
The pipe can be included as an argument to a command by escaping it with a
backslash.
.br
Following commands process the entire command-line string literally.
These commands will include any `|' as part of their argument string and so
can not be followed by another command.

.SS Open
.TP
.BI ":o[pen] [" URI ]
Open the give \fIURI\fP in the current window.
If \fIURI\fP is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.
.TP
.BI ":t[abopen] [" URI ]
Open the give \fIURI\fP in a new window.
If \fIURI\fP is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.
.SS Key Mapping
Key mappings allow users to alter the actions of key presses.
Each key mapping is associated with a mode and only has effect
when the mode is active.
The following commands allow the user to substitute one sequence
of key presses by another.
.PP
.BI Syntax: " :{m}map {lhs} {rhs}"
.PP
Note that the \fIlhs\fP ends with the first found space.
If you want to use space also in the {lhs} you have to escape this
with a single `\\', as shown in the examples.
.sp
The \fIrhs\fP starts with the first non-space char. If you want a \fIrhs\fP
that starts with a space, you have to use "<Space>".
.PP
Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes \fIm\fP:
.PD 0
.IP \fBn\fP
Normal mode: when browsing normally.
.IP \fBi\fP
Insert mode: when interacting with text fields on a website.
.IP \fBc\fP
Command Line mode: when typing into Vimb's command line.
.PD
.PP
Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that you
see on the screen when you type them.
However, as a number of these characters have special meanings, and a
number of keys have no visual representation, a special notation is required.
.PP
As special key names have the format \fI<...>\fP.
The following special keys can be used: <Left>, <Up>, <Right>, <Down>
for the cursor keys, <Tab>, <Esc>, <CR>, <Space>, <BS>, <F1>-<F12> and <C-A>-<C-Z>.
.TP
.BI ":nm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":im[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":cm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
Map the key sequence \fIlhs\fP to \fIrhs\fP for the modes where the map
command applies.
The result, including \fIrhs\fP, is then further scanned for mappings.
This allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.
.RS
.P
Examples:
.PD 0
.IP ":cmap <C-G>h /home/user/downloads/"
Adds a keybind to insert a file path into the input box.
This could be useful for the `:save' command
that could be used as ":save ^Gh".
.IP ":nmap <F1> :set scripts=on<CR>:open !glib<Tab><CR>"
This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked URI with the tag
`glib' and open it immediately if F1 key is pressed.
.IP ":nmap \\\\\ \\\\\  50G"
Example which maps two spaces to go to 50% of the page.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI ":nn[oremap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":ino[remap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":cno[remap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
Map the key sequence \fIlhs\fP to \fIrhs\fP for the mode where the map command
applies.
Disallow mapping of \fIrhs\fP, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.
Often used to redefine a command.
.TP
.BI ":nu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":iu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":cu[nmap] {" lhs }
Remove the mapping of \fIlhs\fP for the applicable mode.
.SS Bookmarks
.TP
.BI ":bma [" tags ]
Save the current opened URI with \fItags\fP to the bookmark file.
.TP
.BI ":bmr [" URI ]
Removes all bookmarks for given \fIURI\fP or, if not given, the current opened
page.
.SS Handlers
Handlers allow specifying external scripts to handle alternative URI methods.
.TP
.BI ":handler-add " "handler" "=" "cmd"
Adds a handler to direct \fIhandler\fP links to the external \fIcmd\fP.
The \fIcmd\fP can contain one placeholder `%s` that will be filled by the
full URI given when the command is called.
.RS
.P
Examples:
.PD 0
.IP ":handler-add mailto=urxvt -e mutt %s"
to start email client for mailto links.
.IP ":handler-add magnet=xdg-open %s"
to open magnet links with xdg-open.
.IP ":handler-add ftp=urxvt -e wget %s -P ~/ftp-downloads"
to handle ftp downloads via wget.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI ":handler-remove " "handler"
Remove the handler for the given URI \fIhandler\fP.
.SS Shortcuts
Shortcuts allow the opening of an URI built up from a named template with additional
parameters.
If a shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you can use it with `:open dd
list of parameters' to open the generated URI.
.PP
Shortcuts are convenient to use with search engines where the URI is standardised
and a single parameter is user defined.
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-add " "shortcut" "=" "URI"
Adds a shortcut with the \fIshortcut\fP and \fIURI\fP template.
The \fIURI\fP can contain multiple placeholders $0-$9 that will be
filled by the parameters given when the shortcut is called.
The parameters given when the shortcut is called will be split
into as many parameters like the highest used placeholder.
.sp
To use spaces within the parameters, the parameters can be grouped by
surrounding them with single-or double quotes-as shown in example shortcut
`map'.
.RS
.P
Examples:
.PD 0
.IP ":shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0"
to setup a search engine.
Can be called by `:open dl my search phrase'.
.IP ":shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1"
to build URIs from given parameters.
Can be called `:open gh fanglingsu vimb'.
.IP ":shortcut-add map=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=$0&daddr=$1"
to search for a route, all but the last parameter must be quoted if they
contain spaces like `:open map "city hall, London" railway station, London'
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-remove " "shortcut"
Remove the search engine to the given \fIshortcut\fP.
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-default " "shortcut"
Set the shortcut for given \fIshortcut\fP as the default, that is the shortcut
to be used if no shortcut is given and the string to open is not an URI. It
doesn't matter if the \fIshortcut\fP is already in use or not to be able to set
it.
.SS Settings
.TP
.BI ":se[t] " var = value

the value was empty.
.TP
.BI ":se[t] " var ^= value
Multiply the \fIvalue\fP to a number option, or prepend the \fIvalue\fP to a
string option.
When the option is a comma separated list, a comma is added,
unless the value was empty.
.TP
.BI ":se[t] " var -= value
Subtract the \fIvalue\fP from a number option, or remove the \fIvalue\fP from
a string option, if it is there.
When the option is a comma separated list, a

.SS Automatic commands
An autocommand is a command that is executed automatically in response to some
event, such as a URI being opened.
Autocommands are very powerful.
Use them with care and they will help you avoid typing many commands.
.PP
Autocommands are built with following properties.
.TP
.I group
When the [\fIgroup\fP] argument is not given, Vimb uses the current group as
defined with ':augroup', otherwise, Vimb uses the group defined with
[\fIgroup\fP].
Groups are useful to remove multiple grouped autocommands.
.TP
.I event
You can specify a comma separated list of event names.
No white space can be used in this list.
.RS

.RE
.PD
.TP
.B header (list)
Comma separated list of headers that replaces default header sent by WebKit or
new headers.
The format for the header list elements is `name[=[value]]'.
.sp
Note that these headers will replace already existing headers.
If there is no '=' after the header name, then the complete header
will be removed from the request, if the '=' is present means that
the header value is set to empty value.
.sp
Note that webkit reused already set headers in case of a reload of a page.
So if there are headers removed that where previously use to access a certain
page and the page is reloaded or opened via back/forward history the header
will still be sent.
To apply the new header setting properly it's required to request another page
or to open current page new by `O<Cr>`.
.sp
To use '=' within a header value the value must be quoted like shown in
Example for the Cookie header.
.RS
.PP
Example:
.PD 0
.IP ":set header=DNT=1,User-Agent,Cookie='name=value'"
Send the 'Do Not Track' header with each request and remove the User-Agent
Header completely from request.

to select it, while all other characters are used to filter hints based
on their text.
With a value such as asdfg;lkjh,
each hint is `labeled' based on the characters of the home row.
.IP
If the hint-keys string starts with a '0' the keys are considered to follow
the rules of numeric labeling. So that the ifrst char of the label will never
start with the '0'.
.IP
Note that the hint matching by label built of hint-keys is case sensitive.
In this vimb differs from some other browsers that show hint labels in upper
case, but match them lowercase.
.IP
To have upper case hint labels, it's possible to add following css to the
`style.css' file in vimb's configuration directory.
.IP
"._hintLabel {text-transform: uppercase !important;}"
