.SH NAME
Vimb - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on WebKit, inspired by Vim: the
great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vimb
.OP OPTIONS
.RI [ URI "|" file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vimb is a WebKit based web browser that behaves like the Vimperator
plugin for Firefox and has usage paradigms from the great editor, Vim.
The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient
and pleasurable browsing-experience.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-config " "FILE"
Use custom configuration given as \fIFILE\fP.
This will also be applied on new spawned instances.
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-embed " "WINID"
.I WINID
of an XEmbed-aware application, that Vimb will use as its parent.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show help options.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
Print build and version information.
.SH MODES
Vimb is modal and has the following main modes:
.TP
.B Normal Mode
The default mode.

.TP
.B Input Mode

.TP
.B Command Mode

.TP
.B Pass-Through Mode
In Pass-Through mode only the `<Esc>` and `<C-[>` keybindings are interpreted
by Vimb, all other keystrokes are given to the webview to handle them.
This allows the use of a website's configured keybindings, that might otherwise
be swallowed by Vimb.

Some of the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply the
effect of the command.
If a command supports the count this is shown as \fB[N]\fP.

.SH COMMAND MODE
Commands that are listed below are ex-commands like in Vim, that are typed
into the inputbox (the command line of vimb).
The commands may vary in their syntax or in the parts they allow,
but in general they follow a simple syntax.
.PP
.BI Syntax: " :[:| ][N]cmd[name][!][ lhs][ rhs]"
.sp
Where \fIlhs\fP (left hand side) must not contain any unescaped space.
The syntax of the rhs (right hand side) if this is available depends on the
command.
At the moment the count parts [N] of commands is parsed, but currently there is
no command that uses the count.
.sp
Commands that are typed interactivly are normally recorded into command
history and register.
To avoid this, the commands can be prefixed by one or more additional `:' or
whitespace.
.PP
Multiple commands, separated by a `|' can be given in a single command line
and will be executed consecutively.
The pipe can be included as an argument to a command by escaping it with a
backslash.
.br
Following commands process the entire command-line string literally.
These commands will include any `|' as part of their argument string and so
cannot be followed by another command.
.PP
.PD 0
.IP - 2
cmap, cnoremap, imap, inoremap, nmap, nnoremap
.IP -
eval
.IP -
normal
.IP -
open, tabopen

.PD
.SS Command Line Editing

.TP
.B CTRL\-W
Deletes the last word before the cursor.
.TP
.B CTRL\-U
Remove everything between cursor and prompt.
.TP

Moves the cursor directly behind the prompt `:'.
.TP
.B CTRL\-E
Moves the cursor after the prompt in inputbox.
.TP
.B CTRL\-V
Pass the next key press directly to GTK.
.TP
.B CTRL\-R {a-z"%:/;}
Insert the content of given register at cursor position.
See also section about `:reg[ister]' command.
.SS Command Line History
.TP
.B <Tab>
Start completion of the content in the inputbox in forward direction.
.TP
.B <S-Tab>
Start completion of the content in the inputbox in backward direction.
.TP
.B <Up>
Step backward in the command history.
.TP
.B <Down>
Step forward in the command history.
Yank the current selection into register \fIx\fP and clipboard.
.SS Open
.TP
.BI ":o[pen] [" URI ]
Open the give \fIURI\fP in the current window.
If \fIURI\fP is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.
.TP
.BI ":t[abopen] [" URI ]
Open the give \fIURI\fP in a new window.
If \fIURI\fP is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.
.SS Key Mapping
Key mappings allow users to alter the actions of key presses.
Each key mapping is associated with a mode and only has effect
when the mode is active.
The following commands allow the user to substitute one sequence
of key presses by another.
.PP
.BI Syntax: " :{m}map {lhs} {rhs}"
.PP
Note that the \fIlhs\fP ends with the first found space.
If you want to use space also in the {lhs} you have to escape this
with a single `\\', as shown in the examples.
.sp
The \fIrhs\fP starts with the first non-space char. If you want a \fIrhs\fP
that starts with a space, you have to use "<Space>".
.PP
Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes \fIm\fP:
.PD 0
.IP \fBn\fP
Normal mode: when browsing normally.
.IP \fBi\fP
Insert mode: when interacting with text fields on a website.
.IP \fBc\fP
Command Line mode: when typing into Vimb's command line.
.PD
.PP
Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that you
see on the screen when you type them.
However, as a number of these characters have special meanings, and a
number of keys have no visual representation, a special notation is required.
.PP
As special key names have the format \fI<...>\fP.
The following special keys can be used: <Left>, <Up>, <Right>, <Down>
for the cursor keys, <Tab>, <Esc>, <CR>, <Space>, <BS>, <F1>-<F12> and <C-A>-<C-Z>.
.TP
.BI ":nm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":im[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":cm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
Map the key sequence \fIlhs\fP to \fIrhs\fP for the modes where the map
command applies.
The result, including \fIrhs\fP, is then further scanned for mappings.
This allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.
.RS
.P
Examples:
.PD 0
.IP ":cmap <C-G>h /home/user/downloads/"
Adds a keybind to insert a file path into the input box.
This could be useful for the `:save' command
that could be used as ":save ^Gh".
.IP ":nmap <F1> :set scripts=on<CR>:open !glib<Tab><CR>"
This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked URI with the tag
`glib' and open it immediately if F1 key is pressed.
.IP ":nmap \\\\\ \\\\\  50G"
Example which maps two spaces to go to 50% of the page.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI ":nn[oremap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":ino[remap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":cno[remap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
Map the key sequence \fIlhs\fP to \fIrhs\fP for the mode where the map command
applies.
Disallow mapping of \fIrhs\fP, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.
Often used to redefine a command.
.TP
.BI ":nu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":iu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":cu[nmap] {" lhs }
Remove the mapping of \fIlhs\fP for the applicable mode.
.SS Bookmarks
.TP
.BI ":bma [" tags ]
Save the current opened URI with \fItags\fP to the bookmark file.
.TP
.BI ":bmr [" URI ]
Removes all bookmarks for given \fIURI\fP or, if not given, the current opened
page.
.SS Shortcuts
Shortcuts allow the opening of an URI built up from a named template with additional
parameters.
If a shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you can use it with `:open dd
list of parameters' to open the generated URI.
.PP
Shortcuts are convenient to use with search engines where the URI is standardised
and a single parameter is user defined.
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-add " "shortcut" "=" "URI"
Adds a shortcut with the \fIshortcut\fP and \fIURI\fP template.
The \fIURI\fP can contain multiple placeholders $0-$9 that will be
filled by the parameters given when the shortcut is called.
The parameters given when the shortcut is called will be split
into as many parameters like the highest used placeholder.
.sp
To use spaces within the parameters, the parameters can be grouped by
surrounding them with single-or double quotes-as shown in example shortcut
`map'.
.RS
.P
Examples:
.PD 0
.IP ":shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0"
to setup a search engine.
Can be called by `:open dl my search phrase'.
.IP ":shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1"
to build URIs from given parameters.
Can be called `:open gh fanglingsu vimb'.
.IP ":shortcut-add map=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=$0&daddr=$1"
to search for a route, all but the last parameter must be quoted if they
contain spaces like `:open map "city hall, London" railway station, London'
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-remove " "shortcut"
Remove the search engine to the given \fIshortcut\fP.
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-default " "shortcut"
Set the shortcut for given \fIshortcut\fP as the default.
It doesn't matter if the \fIshortcut\fP is already in use or not
to be able to set it.
.SS Settings
