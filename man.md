## SYNOPSIS
{:#SYNOPSIS}
**vimb** `[OPTIONS] [URI|file|-]`

## DESCRIPTION
{:#DESCRIPTION}
Vimb is a WebKit based web browser that behaves like the Vimperator plugin for
Firefox and has usage paradigms from the great editor, Vim. The goal of Vimb
is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience.

## OPTIONS
{:#OPTIONS}
If no *URI* or *file* is given vimb will open the configured home-page. If
*URI* is `-`, vimb reads the html to display from stdin.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

−c, −−config *FILE*
: Use custom configuration given as *CONFIG-FILE*. This will also be applied
  on new spawned instances.

−e, −−embed *WINID*
: *WINID* of an XEmbed-aware application, that vimb will use as its parent.

−h, −−help
: Show help options.

−p, −−profile *PROFILE-NAME*
: Create or open specified configuration profile. Configuration data for the
  profile is stored in a directory named *PROFILE-NAME* under default
  directory for configuration data.

−v, −−version
: Print build and version information and then quit.

−−bug-info
: Prints information about used libraries for bug reports and then quit.

## MODES
{:#MODES}
Vimb is modal an has following main modes:

Normal Mode
: The default mode. Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.

Input Mode
: Used for editing text elements in a webpage.

Command Mode
: Execute ex-commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).

Pass-Through Mode
: In Pass-Through mode only the \<Esc\> and \<C-[\> keybindings are
  interpreted by vimb, all other keystrokes are given to the webview to handle
  them. This allows to use websites that uses keybindings itself, that might
  be swallowed by vimb else.

## NORMAL MODE
{:#NORMAL_MODE}
Some of the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply the
effect of the command. If a command supports the count this is shown as
[*N*].

### Hinting
{:#Hinting}
The hinting is the way to do what you would do with the mouse in common mouse-
driven browsers. Open URI, yank URI, save page and so on. If the hinting is
started, the relevant elements on the page will be marked by labels generated
from configured 'hintkeys'. Hints can be selected by using \<Tab\>, \<C-I\> or
\<C-Tab\>, \<C-O\>, by typing the chars of the label, or filtering the elements by
some text that is part of the hinted element (like URI, link text, button
label) and any combination of this methods. If \<enter\> is pressed, the current
active hint will be fired. If only one possible hint remains, this will be
fired automatically.

**Syntax**: `;{mode}{hint}`

Start hint mode. Different elements depending on *mode* are highlighted and
'numbered'. Elements can be selected either by typing their label, or by
typing part of their text (*hint*) to narrow down the result. When an
element has been selected, it is automatically clicked or used (depending on
*mode*) and hint mode ends.

The filtering of hints by text splits the query at ' ' and use the single
parts as separate queries to filter the hints. This is useful for hints that
have a lot of filterable chars in common and it needs many chars to make a
distinct selection. For example `;over tw` will easily select the second
hint out of `{'very long link text one', 'very long link text two'}`.
Following keys have special meanings in Hints mode:

\<CR\>
: Selects the first highlighted element, or the current focused.

\<Tab\>
: Moves the focus to the next hint element.

\<S-Tab\>
: Moves the focus to the previous hint element.

\<Esc\>, CTRL−C, CTRL−[
: Exits Hints mode without selecting an element

#### Hint modes:
{:#Hint_modes}
f
: Is an alias for the `;o` hint mode.

F
: Is an alias for the `;t` hint mode.

;o
: Open hint's location in the current window.

;t
: Open hint's location in a new window.

;s
: Saves the hint's destination under the configured 'download-path'.

;O
: Generate an `:open` prompt with hint's URI.

;T
: Generate an `:tabopen` prompt with hint's URI.

;e
: Open the configured editor ('editor-command') with the hinted form element's
  content. If the file in editor is saved and the editor is closed, the file
  content will be put back in the form field.

;i
: Open hinted image into current window.

;I
: Open hinted image into new window.

;p
: Push the hint's URI to the end of the read it later queue like the `:qpush`
  command. This is only available if vimb was compiled with QUEUE feature.

;P
: Push the hint's URI to the beginning of the read it later queue like the
  `:qunshift` command. This is only available if vimb was compiled with QUEUE
  feature.

;x
: Hints like ;o, but instead of opening the hinted URI, the 'x-hint-command' is
  run in vimb.

[*"x*];y
: Yank hint's destination location into primary and secondary clipboard and into
  the register *x*.

[*"x*];Y
: Yank hint's text description or form text into primary and secondary clipboard
  and into the register *x*.

**Syntax**: `g;{mode}{hint}`

Start an extended hints mode and stay there until \<Esc\> is pressed. Like the
normal hinting except that after a hint is selected, hints remain visible so
that another one can be selected with the same action as the first. Note that
the extended hint mode can only be combined with the following hint modes
*I p P s t y Y*.

#### Motion
{:#hint_mode_motion}
Motions commands are like those for normal mode except that CTRL is used as
modifier. But they can not be used together with a count.

CTRL-F
: Scroll one page down.

CTRL-B
: Scroll one page up.

CTRL-D
: Scroll half page down.

CTRL-U
: Scroll half page up.

CTRL-J
: Scroll one step down.

/QUERY, ?QUERY
: Start searching for `QUERY` in the current page. `/` start search forward,
  `?` in backward direction.

\*, \#
: Start searching for the current selected text, or if no text is selected for
  the content of the primary or secondary clipboard. `*` start the search in
  forward direction and `#` in backward direction.

  Note that this commands will yank the text selection into the clipboard and
  may remove other content from there!

[*N*]n
: Search for *N*th next search result depending on current search direction.

[*N*]N
: Search for *N*th previous search result depending on current search
  direction.

\<CR\>
: Perform a click on element containing the current highlighted search result.

### Zooming

: Reset Zoom.

### Yank
{:#Yank}
[*"x*]y
: Yank the URI or current page into register *x* and clipboard.

[*"x*]Y
: Yank the current selection into register *x* and clipboard.

## COMMAND MODE
{:#COMMAND_MODE}
Commands that are listed below are ex-commands like in vim, that are typed
into the inputbox (the command line of vimb). The commands may vary in their
syntax or in the parts they allow, but in general they follow a simple syntax.

**Syntax:** `:[:| ][N]cmd[name][!][ lhs][ rhs]`

Where *lhs* (left hand side) must not contain any unescaped space. The syntax
of the rhs (right hand side) if this is available depends on the command. At
the moment the count parts [N] of commands is parsed, but actual there does
not exists any command that uses the count.
Commands that are typed interactive (from inputbox or from socket) are
normally recorded into command history and register. To avoid this, the
commands can be prefixed by one or more additional `:` or whitespace.

Multiple commands, separated by a `|` can be given in a single command line
and will be executed consecutively. The pipe can be included as an argument to
a command by escaping it with a backslash.
Following commands process the entire command-line string literally. These
commands will include any `|` as part of their argument string and so can not
be followed by another command.

- autocmd
- cmap, cnoremap, imap, inoremap, nmap, nnoremap
- eval
- normal
- open, tabopen
- shellcmd

### Command Line Editing
{:#Command_Line_Editing}
\<Esc\>, CTRL−[, CTRL-C
: Ignore all typed content and switch back to normal mode.

\<CR\>
: Submit the entered ex command or search query to run it.

CTRL−H
: Deletes the char before the cursor.

CTRL−W
: Deletes the last word before the cursor.

CTRL−U
: Remove everything between cursor and prompt.

CTRL−B
: Moves the cursor direct behind the prompt `:`.

CTRL−E
: Moves the cursor after the char in inputbox.

CTRL−V
: Pass the next key press directly to gtk.

CTRL−R {a-z"%:/;}
: Insert the content of given register at cursor position. See also section
  REGISTERS.

### Command Line History
{:#Command_Line_History}
\<Tab\>
: Start completion of the content in inputbox in forward direction.

\<S-Tab\>
: Start completion of the content in inputbox in backward direction.

\<Up\>
: Step backward in the command history.

\<Down\>
: Step forward in the command history.

### Open
{:#Open}
\:o[pen] [*URI*]
: Open the give *URI* into current window. If *URI* is empty the configured
  'home-page' is opened.

\:t[abopen] [*URI*]
: Open the give *URI* into a new window. If *URI* is empty the configured
  'home-page' is opened.

### Key Mapping
{:#Key_Mapping}
Key mappings allow to alter actions of key presses. Each key mapping is
associated with a mode and only has effect when the mode is active. Following
commands allow the user to substitute one sequence of key presses by another.

**Syntax:** `:{m}map {lhs} {rhs}`

Note that the {lhs} ends with the first found space. If you want to use space
also in the {lhs} you have to escape this with a single ``\`` like shown in the
examples.
The {rhs} starts with the first none space char. If you want a {rhs} that starts
with a space, you have to use `<Space>`.

Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes *m*:

- **n** Normal mode: When browsing normally.
- **i** Insert mode: When interacting with text fields on a website.
- **c** Command Line mode: When typing into the command line of vimb

Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that you see
on the screen when you type them. However, as a number of these characters have
special meanings, and a number of keys have no visual representation, a special
notation is required.

As special key names have the format `<...>`. Following special keys can be
used `<Left>`, `<Up>`, `<Right>`, `<Down>` for the cursor keys, `<Tab>`,
`<Esc>`, `<CR>`, `<Space>`, `<F1>`-`<F12>` and `<C-A>`-`<C-Z>`.

\:nm[ap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
\:im[ap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
\:cm[ap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
: Map the key sequence *lhs* to *rhs* for the modes where the map command applies.
  The result, including *rhs*, is then further scanned for mappings. This allows
  for nested and recursive use of mappings.

: - `:cmap <C-G>h /home/user/downloads/`
    Adds a keybind to insert a file path into the input box. This could be
    useful for the `:save` command that could be used as `:save ^Gh`.
  - `:nmap <F1> :set scripts=on<CR>:open !glib<Tab><CR>`
    This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked URI with the tag
    'glib' and open it immediately if F1 key is pressed.
  - `:nmap \ \  50G;o`
    Example which mappes two spaces to go to 50% of the page, start hinting
    mode.

\:nn[oremap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
\:ino[remap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
\:cno[remap] {*lhs*} {*rhs*}
: Map the key sequence *lhs* to *rhs* for the mode where the map command applies.
  Disallow mapping of *rhs*, to avoid nested and recursive mappings. Often used
  to redefine a command.

\:nu[nmap] {*lhs*}
\:iu[nmap] {*lhs*}
\:cu[nmap] {*lhs*}
: Remove the mapping of *lhs* for the applicable mode.

### Bookmarks
{:#Bookmarks}
\:bma [*tags*]
: Save the current opened URI with *tags* to the bookmark file.

\:bmr [*URI*]
: Removes all bookmarks for given *URI* or, if not given, the current opened
  page.

### Handlers
{:#Handlers}
\:handler-add *handler*=*cmd*
: Adds a handler to direct *handler* links to the external *cmd*. The *cmd* can
  contain one placeholder %s that will be filled by the full URI given when the
  command is called.
: Examples:

: - `:handler-add mailto=urxvt -e mutt %s`
    to start email client for mailto links.
  - `:handler-add magnet=xdg-open %s`
    to open magnet links with xdg-open.
  - `:handler-add ftp=urxvt -e wget %s -P ~/ftp-downloads`
    to handle ftp downloads via wget.

\:handler-remove *handler*
: Remove the handler for the given URI *handler*.

### Shortcuts
{:#Shortcuts}
Shortcuts allows to open URL build up from a named template with additional
parameters. If a shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you can use it with
`:open dd list of parameters` to open the generated URL.

Shortcuts are a good to use with search engines where the URL is nearly the
same but a single parameter is user defined.

\:shortcut-add *shortcut=URI*
: Adds a shortcut with the *shortcut* and URI template. The URI can contain
  multiple placeholders `$0-$9` that will be filled by the parameters given when
  the shortcut is called. The parameters given when the shortcut is called
  will be split into as many parameters like the highest used placeholder.

: - `:shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0`
    to setup a search engine. Can be called by `:open dl my search phrase`.
  - `:shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1`
    to build url from given parameters. Can be called `:open gh fanglingsu vimb`.
  - `:shortcut-add map=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=$0&daddr=$1`
	to search for a route, all but the last parameter must be quoted if they
	contain spaces like `:open map "city hall, London" railway station, London`

\:shortcut-remove *shortcut*
: Remove the search engine to the given *shortcut*.

\:shortcut-default *shortcut*
: Set the shortcut for given shortcut as the default, that is the *shortcut* to
  be used if no shortcut is given and the string to open is not an URI. It
  doesn't matter if the shortcut is already in use or not to be able to set it.

### Settings
{:#Settings}
\:se[t] *var=value*
: Set configuration values named by *var*. To set boolean variable you should
  use 'on', 'off' or 'true' and 'false'. Colors are given as hexadecimal value
  like '#f57700'.

\:se[t] *var+=value*
: Add the *value* to a number option, or apend the *value* to a string option.
  When the option is a comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
  value was empty.

\:set[t] *var^=value*
: Multiply the *value* to a number option, or prepend the *value* to a string
  option. When the option is a comma separated list, a comma is added, unless
  the value was empty.

\:se[t] *var-=value*
: Subtract the *value* from a number option, or remove the *value* from a
  string option, if it is there. When the option is a comma separated list, a
  comma is deleted, unless the option becomes empty.

\:se[t] *var*?
: Show the current set value of variable *var*.

\:se[t] *var*!
: Toggle the value of boolean variable *var* and display the new set value.

### Queue
{:#Queue}
The queue allows to mark URLs for later reading (something like a read it later
list). This list is shared between the single instances of vimb. Only available
if vimb has been compiled with QUEUE feature.

\:qpu[sh] [*URI*]
: Push URI or if not given current *URI* to the end of the queue.

\:qu[nshift] [*URI*]
: Push URI or if not given current *URI* to the beginning of the queue.

\:qp[op]
: Open the oldest queue entry in current browser window and remove it from the
  queue.

\:qc[lear]
: Removes all entries from queue.

### Automatic commands
{:#Autocmd}
An autocommand is a command that is executed automatically in response to some
event, such as a URI being opened. Autocommands are very powerful. Use them
with care and they will help you avoid typing many commands.

Autocommands are built with following properties.

*group*
: When the _group_ argument is not given, Vimb uses the current
  group as defined with ':augroup', otherwise, Vimb uses the group defined
  with _group_. Groups are useful to remove multiple grouped autocommands.

*event*
: You can specify a comma separated list of event names. No white space can be
  used in this list.
: Events:
: - `LoadStarted` Fired if a new page is going to opened. No data has been
	received yet, the load may still fail for transport issues. Out of this
    reason this event has no associated URL to match.
  - `LoadCommitted` Fired if first data chunk has arrived, meaning that the
    necessary transport requirements are established, and the load is being
    performed. This is the right event to toggle content related setting like
    'scripts', 'plugins' and such things.
  - `LoadFinished` Fires when everything that was required to display on the
    page has been loaded.
  - `DownloadStart` Fired right before a download is started. This is fired
    for vimb downloads as well as external downloads if
    'down‐load-use-external' is enabled.
  - `DownloadFinished` Fired if a vimb managed download is finished. For
    external download this event is not available.
  - `DownloadFailed` Fired if a vimb managed download failed. For external
    download this event is not available.

*pat*
: Comma separated list of patterns, matches in order to check if a autocommand
  applies to the URI associated to an event. To use '`,`' within the single
  patterns this must be escaped as '`\,`'.
: Patterns:
: - `\*` Matches any sequence of characters. This includes also `/` in contrast
    to shell patterns.
  - `?` Matches any single character except of `/`.
  - `{one,two}` Matches 'one' or 'two'. Any `{`, `,` and `}` within this
    pattern must be escaped by a '`\`'. `*` and `?` have no special meaning
    within the curly braces.
  - `\` Use backslash to escape the special meaning of '`?*{},`' in the pattern
    or pattern list.

*cmd*
: Any ex command vimb understands. The leading `:` is not required. Multiple
  commands can be separated by `|`.

\:au[tocmd] [*group*] {*event*} {*pat*} {*cmd*}
: Add cmd to the list of commands that vimb will execute automatically on event
  for a URI matching pat autocmd-patterns. Vimb always adds the cmd after
  existing autocommands, so that the autocommands are executed in the order in
  which they were given.

\:au[tocmd]! [*group*] {*event*} {*pat*} {*cmd*}
: Remove all autocommands associated with *event* and which pattern match
  *pat*, and add the command *cmd*. Note that the pattern is not matches
  literally to find autocommands to remove, like vim does. Vimb matches
  the autocommand pattern with *pat*.

\:au[tocmd]! [*group*] {*event*} {*pat*}
: Remove all autocommands associated with *event* and which pattern matches
  *pat*.

\:au[tocmd]! [*group*] * {*pat*}
: Remove all autocommands with patterns matching *pat* for all events.

\:au[tocmd]! [*group*] {*event*}
: Remove all autocommands for *event*.

\:au[tocmd]! [*group*]
: Remove all autocommands.

\:aug[roup] {*name*}
: Define the autocmd group *name* for the following `:autocmd` commands. The
  name "end" selects the default group.

\:aug[roup]! {*name*}
: Delete the autocmd group *name*.

Example:

    :aug mygroup
    :  au LoadCommitted * set scripts=off|set cookie-accept=never
    :  au LoadCommitted http{s,}://github.com/*.https://maps.google.de/* set scripts=on
    :  au LoadFinished https://maps.google.de/* set useragent=foo
    :aug end

### Misc
{:#Misc}
\:cl[earcache]
: Clears all resources currently cached by webkit. Note that this effects all
  running instances of vimb.

\:sh[ellcmd] *cmd*
: Runs given shell *cmd* synchronous and print the output into inputbox. The
  *CMD* can contain multiple `%` chars that are expanded to the current opened
  uri. Also the `~/` to home directory expansion is available.
: Runs given shell *cmd* syncronous and print the output into inputbox.
  Follwing pattern in *cmd* are expanded, `~username`, `~/`, `$VAR` and
  `${VAR}`. A '``\``' before these patterns disables the expansion.
: Following environment variables are set for called shell commands.
: - `VIMB_URI` This variable is set by vimb everytime a new page is opened to
    the URI of the page.
  - `VIMB_TITLE` Contains the title of the current opened page.
  - `VIMB_PID` Contains the pid of the running vimb instance.
  - `VIMB_XID` Holds the X-Window id of the vim window or of the embedding
    window if vimb is started with -e option.
: Example: `:sh ls -la $HOME`

:sh[ellcmd]! *cmd*
: Like `:shellcmd` but runs given shell *cmd* asyncron.
: Example: ``:sh! /bin/sh -c 'echo "`date` $VIMB_URI" >> myhistory.txt'``

\:s[ave] [*path*]
: Download current opened page into configured download directory. If *path* is
  given, download under this file name or path. *Path* is expanded and can
  therefore contain `~/`, `${ENV}` and `~user` pattern.

\:so[ource] [*file*]
: Read ex commands from *file*.

\:q[uit]
: Close the browser. This will be refused if there are running downloads.

\:q[uit]!
: Close the browser independent from an running download.

\:reg[ister]
: Display the contents of all registers.
: Register:
: - `"a` -- `"z` 26 named registers. Vimb fills these registers only when you
    say so.
  - `":` Last executed ex command.
  - `""` Last yanked content.
  - `"%` Curent opened URI.
  - `"/` Last search phrase.
  - `";` Last hinted URL. This can be used in `x-hint-command` to get the URL
    of the hint.

\:e[val] *javascript*
: Runs the given *javascript* in the current page and display the evaluated
  value.
: This comman cannot be followed by antoher command, since any `|` is
  considered part of the command.
: Example: `:eval document.cookie`

\:e[val]! *javascript*
: Like `:e[val]`, but there is nothing print to the input box.

\:no[rmal] [*cmds*]
: Execute normal mode commands *cmds*. This makes it possible to execute normal
  mode commands typed on the input box.
: *cmds* cannot start with a space. Put a count of 1 (one) before it, "1 " is one space.
  This comman cannot be followed by antoher command, since any `|` is
  considered part of the command.
: Example: `:set scripts!|no! R` toggle scripts and reload the page.

\:no[rmal]! [*cmds*]
: Like `:no[rmal]`, but no mapping is applied to *cmds*.

\:ha[rdcopy]
: Print current document. Open a GUI dialog where you can select the printer,
  number of copies, orientation, etc.

## INPUT MODE
{:#INPUT_MODE}
\<Esc\>, CTRL−[
: Switch back to normal mode.

CTRL−O
: Executes the next command as normal mode command and return to input mode.

CTRL−T
: Open configured editor with content of current form field.

CTRL−V
: Pass the next key press directly to gtk.

CTRL−Z
: Enter the pass-through mode.

## COMPLETIONS
{:#COMPLETIONS}
The completions are triggered by pressing \<Tab\> or \<S-Tab\> in the
activated inputbox. Depending of the current inserted content different
completions are started. The completion takes additional typed chars to filter
the completion list that is shown.

commands
: The completion for commands are started when at least `:` is shown in the
  inputbox. If there are given some sore chars the completion will lookup
  those commands that starts with the given chars.

settings
: The setting name completion is started if at least `:set ` is shown in
  inputbox and does also match settings that begins with already typed setting
  prefix.

history
: The history of URIs is shown for the `:open ` and `:tabopen ` commands. This
  completion looks up for every given word in the history URI and titles. Only
  those history items are shown, where the title or URI contains all tags.
